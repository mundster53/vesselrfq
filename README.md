# VesselRFQ

The Compressed Marketplace for ASME Pressure Vessel RFQs.

## Overview

VesselRFQ connects ASME pressure vessel buyers with a curated network of 40 fabricators. 

- **For Buyers:** Define vessel parameters in ~15 minutes instead of 6-8 weeks with consulting engineers
- **For Fabricators:** Compete against 3-4 shops instead of 15, with complete RFQ data and geographic exclusivity
